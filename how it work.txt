How Network Sniffing Works

Packet Capture: Network sniffers intercept data packets as they pass through a network interface. This is typically done by putting the network interface into promiscuous mode, which allows it to capture all traffic, not just packets addressed to the device.
Packet Analysis: Once captured, the packets are analyzed to extract valuable information. This may involve examining the packet headers to identify the source and destination addresses, protocols used, and payload data.
Data Extraction: Sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or confidential emails, can be extracted from the captured packets.
