Here are some effective techniques to protect your network traffic from snooping:

Encryption:

HTTPS: Use HTTPS to encrypt web traffic, ensuring that sensitive information is transmitted securely.
VPN: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic, making it difficult for sniffer to intercept and analyze.
SSH: Secure Shell (SSH) encrypts remote login sessions, protecting your credentials.
Network Security Best Practices:

Strong Passwords: Use strong, unique passwords for all your online accounts.
Firewall: Implement a firewall to filter incoming and outgoing network traffic, blocking unauthorized access.
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): IDS monitors network traffic for signs of malicious activity and alerts you to potential threats.
Regular Updates: Keep your operating system, applications, and network devices up-to-date with the latest security patches.
Be Cautious on Public Wi-Fi:

Avoid Sensitive Activities: Refrain from accessing sensitive information or making online transactions on public Wi-Fi networks.
Use a VPN: A VPN can encrypt your traffic on public Wi-Fi, adding an extra layer of security.
Stay Informed:

Security Awareness: Stay informed about the latest cybersecurity threats and best practices.
Phishing Awareness: Be cautious of phishing attacks, which can trick you into revealing sensitive information.
By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of network sniffing and protect your sensitive data. Remember, a layered approach to security is crucial, and continuous vigilance is essential.
